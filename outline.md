WVSS Programming Club - Outline v0.1
====================================

Outline version = 0.1 (Still in development)
Revisions = 08/31/15 - Create file and set-up basic outline

This file describes what members who are a part of the WVSS Programming Club will learn/do/create through the
duration of the club - the 'club' is more structered towards a introductory course to the consepts of Computer 
Science.
Members will learn the language Python.

Week #1:
--------
* Overview of club (see introduction paragraph at top of file)
* Materials needed - members bring computers if they have one (if no, then use cloud-based text editor/IDE)
* How a program is computed
* Things to take into account when choosing a programming language
    - Compiled vs. Interpreted languages
    - High-Level vs. Low-Level languages
    - General-Purpouse vs. Targeted languages
* Why Python?
* Introduce data and operations (i.e. data => strings, integers, floats, booleans and operations/operators => +,-,etc.)
* Talk about commands/statments - (i.e.) <tt>print()</tt>
* We will talk about the last two if there is time

Week #2:
--------
* If there was no time from last class then we will talk about data, operations and commands/statments (refer to last three points
from Week #1)
* Setting up the environment - for members who brought their own devices and for the cloud-based solution
* Review of last time - talk about data and operations
* Go more in-depth about those topics - exploit some bugs/errors
* Introduce variables/assignment
    - Go over syntax for assignment: <tt><variable_name> = <value></tt> (value can be anythin - almost)
    - How computer creates the variable (variable POINTS to value in memory - the variable is a link to a value in memory)
    - Variables have aliases in Python (two or more variables can point/link to same value)
    - Python as a dyanamic language

Week #3:
--------
* Review of past classes - what we have learned so far (i.e. Data-Types/Values, Operations, Variables/Assignmet, Commands/Statments)
* Go over the kinds of errors/bugs
    - Syntactical errors - easy to solve/debug
    - Sematic errors (how you write your code) - harder
* How to solve them.
* Talk about what kinds of programs we currently write - 'top -> bottom' programs, they get exectued line-by-line in order (top to bottom)
* Branching programs - programs that 'jump' around the file and are more complex and powerful
* Introduce conditional statments (<tt>if/else</tt>)
    - How they work/what they do
    - Syntax

Week #4:
--------
* Review of previous day -  Data-Types/Values, Operations, Variables/Assignmet, Commands/Statments <- Conditional statments
* Introduce iteration or 'loops'
    - While loop
    - Syntax of while loop
* Show some examples for while iteration
* Introduce the Python <tt>for</tt> loop
    - Syntax
    - Counting from 1 to 10 (from x to n using <tt>range(x, n)</tt>)
* Counting from 1 to 10 using while

Week #5:
--------
* Review of iteration (<tt>while</tt> and <tt>for</tt>)
* Introduce lists
    - Syntax
    - Indxing lists
    - List elements
* Looping through a list using the <tt>for</tt> loop
* String indexing
* List aliases
* List mutation

Week #6:
--------
* Review of previous classes
* Talk about list operators
    - Add operation
    - <tt>append()</tt> operator
    - <tt>find()</tt> operator
    - <tt>pop()</tt> operator

Week #7:
--------
* Review of list operations
* Introduce methods/functions
    - Paramaters
    - <tt>return</tt> statment
